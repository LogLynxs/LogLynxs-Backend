LogLynx Business API (v1) — Firestore (NoSQL) Integration & Usage Guide

Goal. Keep Firebase for the assignment, but add a clean REST business layer (Node/Express) so Android/Web/iOS call your API, not Firestore directly.
Store. Firestore (NoSQL) via Firebase Admin SDK.
Auth. Keep Firebase Auth for sign-in; API exchanges Firebase ID tokens for API JWTs.



Architecture (NoSQL-first)

Android / Web / iOS
        │  (HTTP, JSON, JWT)
        ▼
   LogLynx REST API (Node/Express, TypeScript recommended)
        │
        ├─ Firebase Admin SDK (Auth verify, Firestore reads/writes)
        └─ Optional workers (cron) for wear calc, Strava sync, reminders
		
		
Why this shape? Meets the requirement to use Firebase while centralizing business logic, validation, and integrations in your API. You can later swap Firestore → Postgres behind the API without client changes.

2) Collections & Data Modeling (Firestore)

Top-level collections with owner fields for easy queries; subcollections for histories. Prefer flat, queryable patterns; keep documents <1 MiB.

Users

users/{uid}

email, displayName, createdAt, lastLoginAt

prefs: { darkMode: bool, notificationsEnabled: bool, biometricsEnabled: bool }

users/{uid}/devices/{token} — Push tokens (FCM), platform, lastSeen.

Bikes

bikes/{bikeId}

ownerUid, name, type, year, status, totalMileage (int), tags (array)

bikes/{bikeId}/service-logs/{logId}

performedAt (timestamp), title, notes, cost, mileageAtService, items (array/map)

Global “service logs” list = collection group query over service-logs.

Components

components/{componentId}

ownerUid, kind (chain/brake/…), brand, model, spec (map), currentBikeId (nullable)

components/{componentId}/installations/{instId}

bikeId, installedAt, installedOdometer, removedAt?, removedOdometer?

components/{componentId}/wear-snapshots/{snapId}

takenAt, mileageAccumulated, wearPct, notes?

QR

qr-codes/{code} (use short slug as doc id)

targetType ('bike'|'component'), targetId, policy ('owner_only'|'any_authenticated'|'shared_list'), ownerUid, expiresAt?

qr-codes/{code}/shared-users/{uid} — membership for shared_list.

Strava & Activities

strava-connections/{uid}

accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt, athleteId (store securely; consider encryption at rest)

activities/{activityId}

userUid, source ('strava'|'manual'), startedAt, distanceKm, movingTimeSec, bikeId?, raw (map)

Notifications (optional, for audit)

notifications/{id}

userUid, channel, kind, payload, scheduledFor, deliveredAt?


3) Indexes (firestore.indexes.json examples)


{
  "indexes": [
    { "collectionGroup": "service-logs",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION_GROUP",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "bikeId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "performedAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    { "collectionId": "bikes",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "ownerUid", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    { "collectionId": "components",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "ownerUid", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "kind", "order": "ASCENDING" }
      ]
    },
    { "collectionId": "activities",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        { "fieldPath": "userUid", "order": "ASCENDING" },
        { "fieldPath": "startedAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}



Base path: /api/v1

Auth: /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/refresh, /auth/logout, /auth/firebase-exchange

Users: /users/profile, /users/preferences

Bikes: /bikes, /bikes/{bikeId}, /bikes/{bikeId}/components, /bikes/{bikeId}/service-logs, /bikes/{bikeId}/qr-code

Components: /components, /components/{id}, /components/{id}/install, /components/{id}/remove, /components/wear-calculations/preview

Service Logs: CRUD

Notifications: subscribe test/delivery endpoints

Strava: /strava/connect, /strava/callback, /strava/sync

QR Codes: /qr-codes/generate, /qr-codes/scan, /qr-codes/share

Keep the same contracts as your relational design. Only the persistence changes.

Strava Integration (server-side OAuth)

GET /strava/connect → redirect user to Strava OAuth with state (user uid + nonce).

GET /strava/callback → exchange code → store tokens in strava-connections/{uid}.

POST /strava/sync → pull activities since last sync; normalize into activities.

Security: Never expose Strava tokens to clients. Consider encrypting token fields before save.




Notifications

Save push token under users/{uid}/devices/{token}.

Nightly job:

scan components for wearPct >= threshold or “due soon,”

create notifications doc (optional),

send FCM directly (server key).





12) API Conventions

Auth header: Authorization: Bearer <access_jwt>

Validation: Zod/JSON Schema → 400 with field errors.

Idempotency: Accept Idempotency-Key on POST; store a small record in Firestore (idempotency/{key}) to avoid double-creates.

Pagination: Firestore cursor pattern

orderBy a stable field (name, startedAt), limit, startAfter.

Errors

{ "error": { "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "Component not found" } }





Android/Web Integration

Login with Firebase as usual (Google Sign-In supported).

Exchange Firebase ID token → POST /auth/firebase-exchange → receive API {access, refresh}.

Call API endpoints with Authorization: Bearer <access>.

Auto-refresh on 401.

Replace Firestore SDK calls inside the app with Retrofit/Fetch calls to your API.





Jobs & Limits (Firestore specifics)

Batch writes: max 500 operations. Chunk long operations.

Transactions: use for state changes (install/remove) and counters.

Hot docs: avoid frequent writes to the same doc (1 write/sec limit).

For counters, prefer FieldValue.increment across sharded docs if needed.

Collection group queries: design with consistent subcollection names (service-logs).








6) Security & Rules

Clients should not access Firestore directly → keep Firestore Security Rules restrictive (deny by default).

The server uses Admin SDK (bypasses rules) and enforces authz: compare ownerUid to req.user.uid.
